# Augment Fulda

Augmented reality application to help new students of University of applied sciences Fulda to track university buildings.

## Motivation
Since the university comprises of more than 30 buildings it is really hard for a new comer to find a particular building unless he/she goes near to every building and check the label mounted on the wall. Furthermore, it is itself a struggle to find the board where exactly it is :-). Although I am here for more than 6 months but I still struggles to find out a building that's not common for students of computer science department. Considering the mentioned issues I found augmented reality application the best option to solve this problem. **So I present students of Fulda my Augment Fulda application, I hope it will help them track network of buildings**.

## Features

- See geo pointers with building (name) label being augmented on the actual building realtime in the live camera.
- Pointers will change size according to user's distance from them. If user is at distant location they will be smaller otherwise they will resize bigger accordingly.
- All available pointers will be shown in the small radar as `white` dots over the radar.
- Click on pointers visible on live camera to check a particular building's details. For instance offices in that building, available labs as well as *distance* from current location.
- Click on the *show images* button in the bulding details panel to see selected building's inner and outer images.
- Selected pointer will be shown in `Blue` on the radar.
- View the direction of buildings in the live camera using radar.
- View the list of available university's buildings by tapping on the radar.
- See the actual position of a particualar building with the help of direction indicator by selecting a building name from the list.
- Point the camera on a particular building and check which building is this with the help of building detection.
- Once a building is recognized, a banner with building details will be augmented on the live camera until building is within the scene.
